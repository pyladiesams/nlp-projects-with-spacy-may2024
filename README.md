# NLP projects with spaCy

## Workshop description
During this workshop, Vincent will guide you through a small project where he tried to detect programming languages that appear in transcripts from the popular Talk Python podcast. He will use spaCy for this and he will use this task as a motivating example to help kick the tires.

You can ask him anything about the stack and he will also have some freebies to hand out at the end of the session.
